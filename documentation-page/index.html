      <p>Building a PC from scratch is the only sure-fire way to ensure that your system is capable of satisfying all of your personal preferences. When you determine everything that goes into your PC from the power supply up, you know that you'll be able to play the games you want at the frame rates you want. In addition, a home-built PC keeps the door open for upgrades — as technology changes, as your gaming tastes and needs change, or as your budget allows.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Carefully consider what kind of case you want before choosing your components, as well as your budget.</li>
        <li>To decide what components you want, you can either research each individual component or find a pre-made list online.</li>
      </ul>

      <header><h1>CPU</h1></header>
      <p><img src="https://snipboard.io/bgarLh.jpg">A processor (CPU) is the logic circuitry that responds to and processes the basic instructions that drive a computer. The CPU is seen as the main and most crucial integrated circuitry (IC) chip in a computer, as it is responsible for interpreting most of computers commands. CPUs will perform most basic arithmetic, logic and I/O operations, as well as allocate commands for other chips and components running in a computer.</p>
      <p>
        The term processor is used interchangeably with the term central processing unit (CPU), although strictly speaking, the CPU is not the only processor in a computer. The <a href="#Graphics_Card">GPU (graphics processing unit)</a> is the most notable example, but the hard drive and other devices within a computer also perform some processing independently. Nevertheless, the term processor is generally understood to mean the CPU.

    <section class="main-section" id="Motherboard">
      <header><h1>Motherboard</h1></header>
      <p><img src="https://snipboard.io/lQoy8j.jpg">A printed circuit board and foundation of a computer that is the biggest board in a computer chassis. It allocates power and allows communication to and between computer hardware components.</p>
      <p>Each type of motherboard is designed to work with specific types of processors and memory, so they don't work with every processor and type of memory. However, hard drives are mostly universal and work with the majority of motherboards, regardless of the type or brand.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Graphics_Card">
      <header><h1>Graphics Card</h1></header>
      <p><img src="https://snipboard.io/O2V7Mh.jpg">The display adapter or video card installed within the computer to display graphical data with high clarity, color, definition and overall appearance. A graphics card provides high-quality visual display by processing and executing graphical data using advanced graphical techniques, features and functions.</p>
      <p>A graphics card is primarily designed to remove the graphical processing tasks from the processor or RAM. It includes a dedicated graphical processing unit (GPU) and a dedicated RAM that help it to process graphical data quickly. Like most processors, a graphics card also has a dedicated heat sink to keep the heat out of the GPU. A graphics card enables the display of 3-D images, image rasterization, higher pixel ration, a broader range of colors and more. Moreover, a graphics card includes various expansion ports such as AGP, HDMI, TV and multiple monitor connectivity. A graphics card can be integrated within the motherboard or be added on as an extension card.</p>

      <header><h1>Memory</h1></header>
      <p><img src="https://snipboard.io/0BxQ7t.jpg">Random access memory (RAM) is a computer's short-term memory, where data that the processor is currently using is stored temporarily. RAM memory can be accessed much faster than data on a <a href="#Storage">hard disk, SSD</a>, or other long-term storage device, which is why RAM capacity is so important for system performance.</p>
      <p>It can help to think about RAM with the analogy of a physical desktop. Your working space — where you scribble on something immediately — is the top of the desk, where you want everything within arm’s reach and you want no delay in finding anything. That’s RAM. In contrast, if you want to keep anything to work on later, you put it into a desk drawer — or store it on a hard disk, either locally or in the cloud.</p>

      <header><h1>Storage</h1></header>
      <p><img src="https://snipboard.io/eJ9rO2.jpg">Storage is the component of your computer that allows you to store and access data on a long-term basis. Usually, storage comes in the form of a solid-state drive or a hard drive. Storage houses your applications, operating system and files for an indefinite period. Computers need to write information and read it from the storage system so the speed of the storage determines how fast your system can boot up, load and access what you’ve saved.</p>
      <h4>Storage Types:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>HDD - <code>Hard Disk Drives or HDDs</code> are traditional storage devices used in personal computers. These use an electromechanical approach to data storage and retrieval. There are multiple spinning magnetic disks for this purpose.</li>
          <li>SSD - <code>Solid State Drives or SSDs</code> are a type of storage device that stores data on flash memory. They are somewhat more sophisticated than HDDs as they do not have any moving parts.</li>
          <li>NVMe - <code>NVMe</code> stands for Non-Volatile Memory Express. An NVMe SSD is a solid state drive that uses an M.2 form factor to connect to the motherboard, instead of a cable. Additionally, they use PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) interface, which provides a much more efficient way to transfer data.</li>

      <p><img src="https://snipboard.io/SXzaOF.jpg">Converts the domestic alternating current (ac) mains supply voltage (220-240 volts in Europe) into various regulated, low voltage direct current (dc) outputs required by the components that make up the computer system.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="CPU_Cooler">
      <header><h1>CPU Cooler</h1></header>
      <p><img src="https://snipboard.io/cDs6QA.jpg">A device designed to draw heat away from the system CPU and other components in the enclosure. Using a CPU cooler to lower CPU temperatures improves efficiency and stability of the system. Adding a cooling device, however, can increase the overall noise level of the system.</p>
      <h4>CPU cooler types:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Air CPU Coolers - The CPU cooler may consist of a heat sink (a component designed to lower the temperature of an electronic device by dissipating heat into the surrounding air) or combination of a heat sink and fan. These cooling systems are generally referred to as <code>air cooling</code> and are often used in conjunction with systems that are designed to improve airflow.</li>
          <li>Liquid CPU Cooling - Another type of CPU cooling is called <code>liquid cooling</code>, where liquid circulates liquid through small pipes in a heat sink, drawing heat from the CPU to a dedicated radiator located on the system case or enclosure, where it is released into the ambient air outside of the system. The cooled liquid travels back through the system to the CPU to continue the process.</li>
        </ul>
